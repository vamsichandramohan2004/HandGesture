# Hand Gesture Control System

This project demonstrates a **Hand Gesture Recognition System** that uses a webcam to detect and interpret hand gestures for controlling a computer. The system utilizes computer vision techniques powered by **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to capture and process hand movements in real time.

## 🧠 Features

- Detects and tracks hand landmarks using MediaPipe
- Maps hand gestures to specific control actions
- Real-time webcam integration for gesture control
- Easily extendable to support additional gestures

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
